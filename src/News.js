      description: "An upcoming NASA mission could find that there are more rogue planets—planets that float in space without orbiting a sun—than there are stars in the Milky Way, a new study theorizes."

    + "'This gives us a window into these worlds that we would otherwise not have,' said Samson Johnson, an astronomy graduate student at The Ohio State University and lead author of the study. 'Imagine our little rocky planet just floating freely in space—that's what this mission will help us find.'"
+"The study was published today in he Astronomical Journal"

       , description: "Black holes are at the center of almost all galaxies that have been studied so far. They have an unimaginably large mass and therefore attract matter, gas and even light. But they can also emit matter in the form of plasma jets—a kind of plasma beam that is ejected from the center of the galaxy with tremendous energy. A plasma jet can extend several hundred thousand light years far into space."

       +"When this intense radiation is emitted, the black hole remains hidden because the light rays near it are strongly bent leading to the appearance of a shadow. This was recently reported by researchers of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) "
       +"collaboration for the massive black hole in the giant ellipse galaxy M87."

The new images of the comet were taken on 8 August and feature the visitor's coma, the fine shell that surrounds its nucleus, and its dusty output. "
