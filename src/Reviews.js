      +" It’s fair to say that the Big Bang – the cataclysmic event that gave rise to our universe"
      +" some 14 billion years ago – has undoubtedly left its footprint on everything we observe today."
      +" The most permanent of marks, though, is its afterglow, in the form of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)"
      +" – the primordial microwave radiation that fills the universe."

      +"For the first few hundred thousand years, our new-born universe was a" 
      +"teeming, hot, dense plasma, made up of nuclei, electrons and photons. "
      +"But once it was 380,000 years old, the universe had expanded and cooled to"
      +" below 3000 K, allowing neutral atoms, including atomic hydrogen to form."
      +" Thanks to the absence of free electrons, light finally abounded the"
      +" universe (from the 'surface of last scattering') and the CMB emerged."
      +" This relic radiation is therefore a perfect record of our universe during its infancy. The CMB as we detect it today has been stretched to its current microwave wavelength due to the universe’s expansion, and cooled to a temperature of just 2.7 K."
